# Future DevOps Projects: EKS and GitOps

After securing my static site on S3 with CloudFront and HTTPS, I'm shifting focus to container orchestration and GitOps. This post outlines my roadmap for building production-ready EKS clusters with automated deployments.

## Why EKS?

Amazon EKS simplifies Kubernetes management:
- Managed control plane
- Integrated with AWS services (IAM, VPC, ALB)
- Auto-scaling and patching

## GitOps with ArgoCD

GitOps ensures declarative, version-controlled deployments:
- ArgoCD syncs manifests from Git
- Rollbacks and drift detection
- Multi-environment support

## Project Goals

1. Deploy EKS cluster via Terraform
2. Install ArgoCD and essential add-ons
3. Set up CI/CD for application deployments
4. Implement monitoring and security best practices

This will be a significant step toward full-stack DevOps automation.
